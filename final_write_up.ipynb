    "An exploratory analysis of Political Action Committee donations was conducted for the 2020 PA congressional election. As would be expected, most candidates' donations were a small percentage of their total donations; that is, the number of candidates declines as the percentage of PAC donations increases. However, a histogram of the percentage of PAC donations for PA revealed a curious uptick; as the percentage of PAC donations increased over 45%, so did the number of candidates. This would indicate a large amount of PAC influence in the PA elections and warrants extending the analysis to all 50 states. \n"
